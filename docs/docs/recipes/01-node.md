# NodeJS

In this guidebook we'll be mostly covering apps created in the NodeJS ecosystem. At the time of writing (25.05.2024) starting new project should use the newest LTS version **Node 20**.

## Managing NodeJS versions

To manage versions between diffrent projects you should be using version manager like [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) or [Volta](https://volta.sh/)

## Locking project into specific NodeJS version

To have source of truth on the Node version for the project it is recommended to use `.tool-versions` (which is BTW a good place for storing many more tool versions).
