# Package Manager

For the speed, disk efficiency, workspaces (monorepo) handling we chose to use [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) as our main package manager.

It flawlessly integrates with Turborepo for the monorepo stuff we're having, offers easier CI management when deploying apps located in the monorepo.

```
TIP: alias pnpm as `p`
```
