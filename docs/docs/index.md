Every tool mentioned in the docs is a PROPOSAL that has been tested in production, but feel free to use alternatives if you prefer them. Let us also know them (`@mikoscz` `@bart` `@kieu`) so we can also test them and update if necessary!

Every project part recommendation has been tested in production and if you're taking a diffrent approach on your project, please leave an ADR with the decision and let us know (`@mikoscz` `@bart` `@kieu`) so we can valuate it into our stack.
